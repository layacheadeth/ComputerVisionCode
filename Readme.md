# Flower classification and segmentation using Oxford Flower dataset

The task is to create a classification and segmentation model that can predict and segment accurately on unseen data. 

For classification, we use ResNet-50 and modified the output layer to fit our need.

For Classification model, we received an accuracy of 89.1%.

For segmentation, we built the convolutional neural network from scratch. 

For segmentation model, we received an accuracy of 94.1%.
